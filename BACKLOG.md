# Smart Campus Management System — Feature Backlog

The product scope is defined by the Agile backlog: **6 epics, 48 stories**. This
file is the canonical feature reference for the app and the implementation
backlog. Story IDs (e.g. `MNT-2`) are stable handles — use them in commits,
branches, and PRs.

Roles in the spec: **Student, Faculty, Administrator, Maintenance Staff,
Maintenance Supervisor, Event Organizer** (plus Project Analyst / QA Engineer for
discovery & UAT stories, which are process work, not app features).

> The current `Role` enum only has `STUDENT`, `ADMINISTRATOR`, `MAINTENANCE_STAFF`.
> `FACULTY`, `MAINTENANCE_SUPERVISOR`, and `EVENT_ORGANIZER` must be added before
> the epics that depend on them (see Phase 0).

## Status legend

- ✅ **Done** — implemented and matches acceptance criteria.
- 🟡 **Partial** — exists but missing acceptance criteria (gaps noted).
- ⬜ **Not started**.

Discovery (`*-1`) and QA/UAT (`*-8`) stories are process artifacts; they are
listed for completeness but are not coding tasks.

## Epic 1 — Student Management Portal

| ID | Story | Status | Notes / gaps |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| STU-1 | Workflow discovery | n/a | Process |

# Implementation progress — ALL EPICS COMPLETE

- ✅ **Phase 0** — roles + ticket statuses expanded; centralized role list.
- ✅ **Epic 1 (Student Portal, STU-2..7)** — registration gaps, password reset, profile fields, courses, attendance, academic records.
- ✅ **Epic 2 (Facility Booking, FAC-2..7)**.
- ✅ **Epic 3 (Asset Tracking, AST-2..7)** — QR is a dependency-free token+scan page.
- ✅ **Epic 4 (Maintenance gaps, MNT-2..7)** — category/room/photos, technician queue + tasks, SLA (URGENT labeled "Critical"), feedback + reopen.
- ✅ **Epic 5 (Campus Events, EVT-2..7)** — QR check-in via token page.
- ✅ **Epic 6 (Analytics & Notifications, ANA-2..7)** — reports + CSV export (dependency-free charts), notification center/rules/delivery log.
- ✅ Landing, login, and register pages redesigned.
- ✅ Phase 0 primitives: `app/lib/email.ts` (P0.5 stub), `app/lib/upload.ts` (P0.3), `app/lib/qr.ts` (P0.4).

**Full integration verified:** `tsc` clean, **125 unit tests pass** (9 files), `npm run lint` clean, `next build` succeeds (~35 routes).

**Remaining caveats / follow-ups (not blocking):**
- Migrations are hand-written (no local DB) — run `prisma migrate deploy` against a real Neon database, in timestamp order.
- Optional spec extras deferred: profile-photo upload + printable transcript (STU-4/7); PDF/Excel export (ANA-7, CSV shipped). Real blob storage + email provider need wiring behind the existing stubs.
- ANA-4/ANA-6 reports were built against available data; now that Epic 1/4 fields exist they can be enriched (enrollment/attendance risk, SLA breach, feedback ratings).

# Implementation backlog (ordered)

Phases are ordered by dependency. Each task is a shippable unit; check off as
completed. Follow the existing architecture (see `CLAUDE.md`): Server Actions
with `requireUser`/`requireRole` guards, pure validators in `app/lib/validation.ts`
with colocated tests, query-param + `ActionToast` feedback, `revalidatePath` on
mutation.

## Phase 0 — Foundations (unblock everything else)

- [ ] **P0.1** Extend `Role` enum: add `FACULTY`, `MAINTENANCE_SUPERVISOR`, `EVENT_ORGANIZER`; update `parseRole`, `requireRole` call sites, and `/admin/users` role selector.
- [ ] **P0.2** Reconcile maintenance enums with spec: add `WAITING` to `TicketStatus`; decide `URGENT` vs `CRITICAL` naming for `TicketPriority` (pick one, migrate).
- [ ] **P0.3** Add file/image upload primitive (storage choice + `app/lib/upload.ts` with format + size validation). Reused by STU-4 photo, MNT-3 images.
- [ ] **P0.4** Add reusable QR generation/scan utilities (`app/lib/qr.ts`). Reused by AST-6 and EVT-6.
- [ ] **P0.5** Add email-sending primitive (`app/lib/email.ts`) behind an interface (no-op in dev). Reused by STU-3 reset and ANA-3.
- [ ] **P0.6** Generalize the `Notification` creation path into `app/lib/notifications.ts` so every module emits consistently.

## Phase 1 — Complete Epic 1 (Student Portal)

- [ ] **STU-2** Add university-email-domain allowlist to `validateRegisterInput`; collect + store `studentId` + academic fields at signup; block duplicate `studentId`.
- [ ] **STU-3** Password reset: `PasswordReset` model (token, userId, expires, usedAt); request page + action (emails link via P0.5); reset page + action; enforce single-use + expiry.
- [ ] **STU-4** Profile: add `address`, `emergencyContact` to `User`; profile photo upload (P0.3); surface fields on dashboard profile form.
- [ ] **STU-5** Course enrollment: `Course` + `Enrollment` models; eligible-courses view; enroll action with seat/prerequisite/duplicate checks.
- [ ] **STU-6** Attendance: `Attendance` model; course-wise % dashboard, low-attendance threshold alert, course/month filters.
- [ ] **STU-7** Academic records: grades/GPA model; read-only semester view; completed vs pending; downloadable/printable summary.

## Phase 2 — Epic 4 (Maintenance) gaps

- [ ] **MNT-2** Add `category`, `building`, `roomNumber`, human-readable ticket reference to `MaintenanceTicket` + form + validator.
- [ ] **MNT-3** Image attachments on tickets (P0.3); staff-visible gallery.
- [ ] **MNT-4** Dedicated unassigned queue + technician task-list views; assignment notification.
- [ ] **MNT-5** SLA: `slaDueAt` + `slaBreached` on ticket, computed from priority/category; supervisor queue with overdue highlight + critical-first ordering. (needs `MAINTENANCE_SUPERVISOR` from P0.1)
- [ ] **MNT-6** Add `WAITING` handling; lock editing of `CLOSED` tickets unless reopened.
- [ ] **MNT-7** `TicketFeedback` model (rating + comment); reopen request flow visible to admin/supervisor.

## Phase 3 — Epic 2 (Facility Booking)

- [ ] **FAC-2** `Facility` model + admin-managed catalog; hide inactive from regular users.
- [ ] **FAC-3** Search + filters page.
- [ ] **FAC-4** Availability calendar (day/week/month), reflect existing bookings, block past slots.
- [ ] **FAC-5** `Booking` model + request form; validation; double-booking prevention; booking history.
- [ ] **FAC-6** Admin approve/reject with comments; slot blocking/release; requester notification.
- [ ] **FAC-7** Cancel + reschedule (re-check availability); notifications.

## Phase 4 — Epic 3 (Asset Tracking)

- [ ] **AST-2** `Asset` model + registration; unique asset ID; duplicate-serial flag.
- [ ] **AST-3** Categories + location mapping; filtering; location history.
- [ ] **AST-4** Allocation to faculty/department; status transitions; allocation history.
- [ ] **AST-5** Return + transfer (with admin approval); history.
- [ ] **AST-6** QR generation/scan (P0.4); read-only scan view for unauthorized; scan audit log.
- [ ] **AST-7** `AssetHistory` model — immutable, timestamped, prev→new + user; status filter.

## Phase 5 — Epic 5 (Events)

- [ ] **EVT-2** `Event` model + creation (faculty/admin); Draft state.
- [ ] **EVT-3** Publish/unpublish/categorize; student listing + category filters.
- [ ] **EVT-4** `EventRegistration` model; eligibility/seat/duplicate checks.
- [ ] **EVT-5** Waitlist queue + auto-promotion + notifications.
- [ ] **EVT-6** QR check-in (P0.4); registered-only, no-duplicate, timestamped, live count.
- [ ] **EVT-7** `EventFeedback` model; attendee-only feedback; participation report + download.

## Phase 6 — Epic 6 (Analytics & Notifications)

- [ ] **ANA-2** Notification history view + per-notification read controls.
- [ ] **ANA-3** Configurable notification triggers + email delivery (P0.5); delivery-status + failure log.
- [ ] **ANA-4** Student analytics report (filters + charts + access control). *(needs Phase 1)*
- [ ] **ANA-5** Facility utilization report + export. *(needs Phase 3)*
- [ ] **ANA-6** Maintenance KPI dashboard. *(needs Phase 2, esp. MNT-5 SLA)*
- [ ] **ANA-7** Asset + event analytics + PDF/Excel export. *(needs Phases 4 & 5)*

**Per-story Definition of Done** (mirrors the spec's QA/UAT `*-8` stories): all
acceptance criteria met, a colocated `*.test.ts` for any new validator/pure
logic, role-based access enforced via session guards, and outcomes surfaced
through `ActionToast`.
